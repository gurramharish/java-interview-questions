## Java Interview Questions

1. Can you explain the concept of multithreading in Java and how it differs from parallel processing?

    In Java, multithreading refers to the ability of a program to execute multiple threads concurrently. A thread is a lightweight, independent unit of execution that contains its own program counter, stack, and local variables. By creating multiple threads, a program can perform multiple tasks simultaneously, improving performance and responsiveness.

    Parallel processing, on the other hand, refers to the concurrent execution of multiple tasks or threads on multiple processors or cores. This allows a program to take advantage of the increased processing power of modern CPUs, and can lead to significant performance gains.

    In summary, multithreading is a way to improve the performance and responsiveness of a program by allowing it to execute multiple threads concurrently. Parallel processing is a technique to improve the performance of a program by executing multiple tasks or threads concurrently on multiple processors or cores.

2. How would you go about designing and implementing a high-performance and scalable distributed system using Java?
    Identify the requirements of the system: Understand the performance and scalability requirements of the system, such as the expected number of users, the volume of data to be processed, and the expected response time.

    Design the architecture: Based on the requirements, design a suitable architecture for the system. This could include the use of microservices, load balancers, and message queues to distribute the workload across multiple machines.

    Choose the right technologies: Select the appropriate technologies and libraries to implement the system. For example, use a non-blocking, asynchronous framework such as Netty or Vert.x for building high-performance, scalable network applications, and a distributed database such as Cassandra or MongoDB to store and retrieve data.

    Optimize performance: Optimize the performance of the system by using techniques such as caching, indexing, and denormalization.

    Monitor and measure performance: Continuously monitor and measure the performance of the system to identify bottlenecks and issues. Use tools such as JMX, Jprofiler, and VisualVM to monitor the system's performance.

    Scale horizontally: Scale the system horizontally by adding more machines to handle the increased workload. Use techniques such as sharding and partitioning to distribute the data and workload across multiple machines.

    Test and deploy: Test the system thoroughly and deploy it in a production environment. Continuously monitor and measure the system's performance in production and make adjustments as necessary.

    It's important to note that this is a high-level overview and depending on the complexity of the system, there could be more steps involved. Additionally, Java is not the only option to implement a distributed system, other languages such as Erlang, Go, and Rust, have also been used successfully for building distributed systems.

3. Can you give an example of a design pattern you've used in your past projects and explain its implementation in Java?

    Creational patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The following are examples of creational patterns in Java:

    Singleton: This pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. This pattern is often used for logging, driver objects, caching and thread pool, database connections. For example, a logging class could be implemented as a singleton to ensure that only one instance of the class is created and all log messages are sent to that one instance.
    
    ```java
    public class Logger {
        private static Logger instance = null;
        private Logger() {}
        public static Logger getInstance() {
            if (instance == null) {
                instance = new Logger();
            }
            return instance;
        }
        // rest of the class
    }
    ```

    Factory Method: This pattern defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. This pattern is often used when a class can't anticipate the type of objects it must create. The factory pattern is also known as the virtual constructor.

    ```java
    interface Shape {
        void draw();
    }

    class Circle implements Shape {
        @Override
        public void draw() {
            System.out.println("Inside Circle::draw() method.");
        }
    }

    class Square implements Shape {
        @Override
        public void draw() {
            System.out.println("Inside Square::draw() method.");
        }
    }

    class ShapeFactory {
        public Shape getShape(String shapeType) {
            if (shapeType == null) {
                return null;
            }
            if (shapeType.equalsIgnoreCase("CIRCLE")) {
                return new Circle();
            } else if (shapeType.equalsIgnoreCase("SQUARE")) {
                return new Square();
            }
            return null;
        }
    }
    ```

    Abstract Factory: This pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. This pattern is often used when a system should be independent of how its products are created, composed, and represented.

    ```java
    interface AbstractFactory {
        public ProductA createProductA();
        public ProductB createProductB();
    }

    class ConcreteFactory1 implements AbstractFactory {
        @Override
        public ProductA createProductA() {
            return new ConcreteProductA1();
        }
        @Override
        public ProductB createProductB() {
            return new ConcreteProductB1();
        }
    }

    class ConcreteFactory2 implements AbstractFactory {
        @Override
        public ProductA createProductA() {
            return new ConcreteProductA2();
        }
        @Override
        public ProductB createProductB() {
            return new ConcreteProductB2();
        }
    }
    ```
    
    Builder: This pattern separates the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations. This pattern is often used when the algorithm for creating a complex object should be independent of the parts that make up the object and how they're assembled.
    Copy code
    class Computer {
        private String HDD;
        private String RAM;
        private boolean isGraphicsCardEnabled;
        private boolean isBluetoothEnabled;
        //getters and setters
    }


    ```java
    class ComputerBuilder {
        private String HDD;
        private String RAM;
        private boolean isGraphicsCardEnabled;
        private boolean isBluetoothEnabled;
        public ComputerBuilder setHDD(String hdd) {
            this.HDD=hdd;
            return this;
        }
        public ComputerBuilder setRAM(String ram) {
            this.RAM=ram;
            return this;
        }
        public ComputerBuilder setGraphicsCardEnabled(boolean isGraphicsCardEnabled) {
            this.isGraphicsCardEnabled=isGraphicsCardEnabled;
            return this;
        }
        public ComputerBuilder setBluetoothEnabled(boolean isBluetoothEnabled) {
            this.isBluetoothEnabled=isBluetoothEnabled;
            return this;
        }
        public Computer build() {
            return new Computer(this);
        }
    }
    ```
    Prototype: This pattern specifies the kind of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype. This pattern is often used when creating a new object is expensive or complex.
    Copy code
    interface Prototype {
        public Prototype getClone();
    }

    class PrototypeImpl implements Prototype {
        @Override
        public Prototype getClone() {
            return new PrototypeImpl();
        }
    }
    These are some of the most common Creational patterns used in Java, each of these patterns has its own set of advantages and trade-offs, it's important to understand the problem at hand and choose the pattern that best suits the situation.
