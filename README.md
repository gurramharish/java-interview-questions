## Java Interview Questions

1. Can you explain the concept of multithreading in Java and how it differs from parallel processing?

    In Java, multithreading refers to the ability of a program to execute multiple threads concurrently. A thread is a lightweight, independent unit of execution that contains its own program counter, stack, and local variables. By creating multiple threads, a program can perform multiple tasks simultaneously, improving performance and responsiveness.

    Parallel processing, on the other hand, refers to the concurrent execution of multiple tasks or threads on multiple processors or cores. This allows a program to take advantage of the increased processing power of modern CPUs, and can lead to significant performance gains.

    In summary, multithreading is a way to improve the performance and responsiveness of a program by allowing it to execute multiple threads concurrently. Parallel processing is a technique to improve the performance of a program by executing multiple tasks or threads concurrently on multiple processors or cores.
